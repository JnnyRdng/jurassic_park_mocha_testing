# Jurassic Park Management

## The Brief

The brief is to create software for Jurassic Park owner John Hammond to help him manage his theme park. He needs to be able to track and manage information about the various dinosaurs in his park and the number of visitors that they will attract.

## Learning Objectives
- Be able to use the fundamental JavaScript language features and data types
- Be able to create an application using multiple interacting objects

## What are we using?


We're using javascript prototyping to create our park and dinosaur objects, and it's being tested with Mocha to make sure it all works as expected.

## How do I get started?

```
git clone git@github.com:JnnyRdng/jurassic_park_mocha_testing.git
```
```
cd jurassic_park_mocha_testing
```
```
npm install
```
```
npm test
```
